GlobiStream
------------------------

GlobiStream is a friendly user interface for the CLI program "Livestreamer"
that you can find here : https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer

It is necessary to install Livestreamer before building Globistream.
You will also need Qt 4.8 to build the project.

GlobiStream connects to a server that monitors a given list of streams, checking
every minute to see if they are online or not. The server application is not available
yet but I'll create a new repository when I'm not too busy.

By default, it connects to the server application running on my computer which monitors
some streams already. You can suggest the server to monitor the streams of your choice.


Installation
------------------------

qmake
make release

This should suffice to build GlobiStream.
You can find the dynamic dependencies in the "libs" folder.
